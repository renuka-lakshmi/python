"""
looping statementa are as called as iterative statements

these statements are used to run a particular condition
no of times...
they are bordly divided into two types 
1. while
2. for 
"""
#while : it executes when the condition is true
"""
syntax:while condition:
            statements
            exit condition/incrementation

"""
#eg1:
# i=1
# while i<=10:
#     #print(i)-->in this particular line the
#     #"i"value runs "n"times because no incrementation/exit cond specifi
#     print("the value",i)
#     i+=1

# #eg2:
# while True:
#     print("the while condition")
# #note:as default condition is true the while loop runs"infinity"times

# #eg3:
# while False:
#     print("the while condition")
#Note :as while is called as entry control
# loop it just checks the condition in the entrance
# as default false is given as coondition it wont execute 

"""
JUMPING ARE TRANSFER STATEMENTS
these statements are used to control the normal
execution of a program they are of "2" types
1. Break:thi sstatement is used to terminate/break the loop
2.continue:this statements are used to skip current iteration and run the next iteration

"""

# i=0
# while i<=10:
#     i+=1
#     if i==6:
#         break
#     print(i)




# i=0
# while i<=10:
#     i+=1
#     if i==6:
#         continue#skips the current iteration
#     print(i)
